# Visualizing Data with Leaflet


Welcome to the United States Geological Survey, or USGS for short! The USGS is responsible for providing scientific data about natural hazards, the health of our ecosystems and environment; and the impacts of climate and land-use change. Their scientists develop new methods and tools to supply timely, relevant, and useful information about the Earth and its processes. As a new hire, you will be helping them out with an exciting new project!

The USGS is interested in building a new set of tools that will allow them visualize their earthquake data. They collect a massive amount of data from all over the world each day, but they lack a meaningful way of displaying it. Their hope is that being able to visualize their data will allow them to better educate the public and other government organizations (and hopefully secure more funding..) on issues facing our planet.


## Tasks


### Level 1: Basic Visualization



Attached is a map using Leaflet that plots **all earthquakes from the past 7 days** based on their longitude and latitude.


  * The markers reflects the magnitude of the earthquake by their size and and depth of the earth quake by color. Earthquakes with higher magnitudes appears larger and earthquakes with greater depth should appear darker in color.


  * When a marker is clicked, popups will appear with additional information about the earthquake .


  * A legend that provide context for the map data is located on the bottom right corner.

### Level 2: More Data


This step plot a second data set on the map to illustrate the relationship between tectonic plates and seismic activity. Data on tectonic plates pulled from https://github.com/fraxen/tectonicplates.
